Instructions for the program “Predict genre with lyrics”1: Download the dataset from the following website: https://www.kaggle.com/gyani95/380000-lyrics-from-metrolyrics2: Save the dataset in the “data” folder which is located in the same folder as the program.3: Convert the dataset from lyrics.csv to lyrics.txt. This can be done by simply renaming the suffix.4: Run the requirements.txt to download all dependencies.5: You are ready to run the code (the main file). By adding one (or multiple) of the following Arguments you will generate different output:“kpi” – Outputs precision, recall and other KPI for all classification models“plot” – generate a plot of the genre distribution“cm” – generate the confusion matrixes of all classification models“vp” – will vary the parameters of ngram and min documents and output a plot. Takes a lot of time! (>30 min, probably more)No matter the argument the code will always output accuracy for each model.Example: “python3 main.py kpi plot cm”Time duration of running the example above:Preprocessing = 13 minutesTraining (all) models = 17 minutes
Predicting values = 8 minutes

Code execution overall =  43 minutes
